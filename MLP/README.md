I changed the code below:\
\
I added some comments to understand the structure of the code.\
\
in layers.py\
I implemented 
Relu forward method, 
Relu backward method,
Sigmoid forward method,
Sigmoid backward method,
Linear forward method,
Linear backward method.\
I changed all input -> x,
all output -> y, so that it can be easier for me to understand.\
\
in loss.py\
I implemented EuclideanLoss forward method, 
Euclidean backward method.\
\
in run_mlp.py\
I changed the structure of NN.\
I changed the training area so that it can remember time and plot an image.\
\
in solve_net.py\
I add Acur and Loss list so that it can remember the change of them during the training.
